#Techtrends

##Background

TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them.

Imagine the following scenario: you joined a small team as a Platform Engineer. The team is composed of 2 developers, 1 platform engineer (you), 1 project manager, and 1 manager. The team was assigned with the TechTrends project, aiming to build a fully functional online news sharing platform. The developers in the team are currently working on the first prototype of the TechTrends website. As a platform engineer, you should package and deploy TechTrends to Kubernetes using a CI/CD pipeline.

The web application is written using the Python Flask framework. It uses SQLite, a lightweight disk-based database to store the submitted articles.

Below you can examine the main components of the firsts prototype of the application:
